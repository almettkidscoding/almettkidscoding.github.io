&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.

    squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
